Machine Learning is a subset of AI.
Supervised learning uses labeled data.
Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in data. Deep learning models are a type of neural network. ML algorithms improve over time with more data.
Machine learningâ€™s impact extends to autonomous vehicles, drones, and robots, enhancing their adaptability in dynamic environments.
