The definition of Deep learning is that it is the branch of machine learning that is based on artificial neural network architecture. 
An artificial neural network or ANN uses layers of interconnected nodes called neurons.
Neurons works together to process and learn from the input data.
Deep learning AI can be used for supervised, unsupervised as well as reinforcement machine learning.
